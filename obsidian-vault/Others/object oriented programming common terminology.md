1. Encapsulation : Encapsulation is the process of wrapping or bundling several things. In programming, we encapsulate functions and variables in a class or variable in a structure. Encapsulation can be understood by : Chocolates packed in a box.

2. Objects : objects are specific instance of class. You can think of a class as a cookie cutter (blueprint), and objects as the actual cookies made using that cutter. Each cookie is an instance of the shape defined by the cutter, but each one can have different decorations (attributes) and actions (methods).

3. Inheritance : inheritance means deriving something from a specific thing. In the context of programming, classes can inherit other classes by which they can access other classes functions and variables. 

4. Superclass or Parentclass : A **superclass** in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a class that serves as a parent or base class for one or more other classes. The **subclass**  inherits from the superclass.

5. Namepspaces : Namespaces is a concept to avoid name conflicts in programs. when there are two same name things present in the same scope of a program then it becomes hard for the compiler to understand to whom to refer. Namespaces solve this by grouping related entities and functions under a single group name. We can have one unique entity of a name in a namespace and can have multiple in many namespaces. It's like having two students with the same name in the class. So whenever the teacher calls a student then there's a conflict. So the teacher uses the fullname of the student or the surname of the student to identify him uniquely. 

6. statically-typed language : a statically typed language is a language in which the variables are needed to be declared firstly before used or initialized. 

7. Primitive Data Types : primitive data types are types predefined by the language meaning their structure and working is already defined by the language itself. This are the most basic type of data which cannot be broken down into further. They are the builtin data types.
